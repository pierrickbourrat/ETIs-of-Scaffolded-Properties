## Overview

This NetLogo model explores the early phases of an **evolutionary transition in individuality (ETI)**. It enables the study of how Darwinian properties are acquired at a new level from processes that can be described purely from the lower level and interaction with the environment at that level.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

To run the model, download and install [**NetLogo**](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/).

> ðŸ”— **Download NetLogo:** [https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/)

### Running the Model

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the file `ETIofSP_BJPS.nlogo` in NetLogo.
3. Use the model interface:
   - Select a **scaffolding regime** (`no-scaffold`, `scaffold`, or `reverted`)
   - Adjust parameters via the **sliders**
   - Click `setup` to initialize
   - Click `go` to begin the simulation

Refer to the associated publication and model documentation for detailed behavior and interpretation of results.
